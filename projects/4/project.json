Previous studies focused on simulating the impacts of AVs on traffic flow, investigating car-following situations, and using simulation analysis lacking experimental tests of human drivers.MethodThirty-six drivers were classified into three driver groups (aggressive, moderate, and defensive drivers) and experienced HV-AV interaction and HV-HV interaction in a supervised web-based experiment. Drivers’ subjective feelings and decision making were collected via questionnaires.ResultsResults revealed that aggressive and moderate drivers felt significantly more anxious, less comfortable, and were more likely to behave aggressively in HV-AV interaction than in HV-HV interaction. Aggressive drivers were also more likely to take advantage of AVs on the road. In contrast, no such differences were found for defensive drivers indicating they were not significantly influenced by the type of vehicles with which they were interacting.ConclusionDriving style and type of interaction significantly influenced drivers’ subjective feelings and decision making in mixed traffic. This study brought insights into how human drivers perceive and interact with AVs and HVs on the road and how human drivers take advantage of AVs.ApplicationThis study provided a foundation for developing guidelines for mixed transportation systems to improve driver safety and user experience.",

As a result, to achieve all-weather and robust autonomous driving, the vehicle must precisely understand its environment.

The interactive behavior considered in this research includes interactive events and trajectories that are modeled as spatial-temporal graphs using the GNN. Under the GNN-MTLF, the prediction process contains two main parts: recognition of interactive events and prediction of interactive trajectories.

Secondly, a longitudinal game strategy for HVs is established with consideration of the driver's longitudinal handling characteristics and personalized aggressiveness, with which the driving behaviors of HVs can be accurately predicted. Thirdly, the longitudinal game strategies for AVs at different positions are designed, with consideration of the safety constraints of AVs and surrounding vehicles, as well as the objectives of comfort and traffic efficiency. Then, the interactive games of ego AV, HVs, and other AVs in different types of mixed-driving environments are solved based on the Stackelberg game and partial cooperative game methods. Finally, the optimal lane-changing (LC) gaps and longitudinal speed trajectories of AVs are obtained. Human-in-the-loop experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning framework in lane-changing scenarios involving HVs with different aggressiveness and response delays.",

Most current autonomous driving algorithms make braking and stopping decisions in a traffic emergency. However, such decisions may not be optimal. In this paper, we study the optimal collision avoidance decision-making method for emergencies. To address this challenge, we propose a cooperative decision-making scheme for CAVs in an emergency. Unlike previous decision-making methods, our scheme enables vehicles to avoid collisions by indicating the optimal emergency destinations, which leads to a new task: the prediction of the optimal collision avoidance destination. In the proposed scheme, the potential collision avoidance destinations are evaluated based on a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, and we propose a safety evaluation map (SEM) to describe the evaluation results. The cooperative ability of CAVs is considered in the proposed scheme, and a well-designed reward function is applied to train the DRL model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately evaluate potential collision avoidance destinations and is effective in reducing traffic accident rates and accident damage in various traffic emergencies compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

Trajectory planning is a significant component of autonomous vehicle system, which directly influences the automated traffic safety.

The non-time-based reference trajectory can be obtained by using high-definition map and lane detection. Then model predictive control is utilized to optimize the reference trajectory according to the current state of autonomous vehicle. Different prediction horizons and coordinate transformation are adopted to optimize the planning. By doing so, the constraint conditions can be easily involved and the result is more intuitive. The probabilistic occupancy of other traffic participants are computed offline and then the obtained results are used in real-time application. Therefore, the real-time computational burden is reduced. The crash probability is put forward to verify the feasibility of real-time trajectory in safety assessment module. Two typical scenarios are analyzed: lane change on the straight road and turning at the intersection. The simulation results illustrate the efficiency of our method.",

More specifically, performance indicators of environment perception and motion planning modules are reviewed as they are the most complicated ADS modules. The need for the incorporation of the level of threat an obstacle poses in the performance metrics is described. A methodology to quantify the level of threat of an obstacle is presented in this regard. The approach involves simultaneously considering multiple stimulus parameters (that elicit responses from drivers), thereby not ignoring multivariate interactions. Human-likeness of ADS is a desirable characteristic as ADS share road infrastructure with humans. The described method can be used to develop human-like perception and motion planning modules of ADS. In this regard, performance metrics capable of quantifying human-likeness of ADS are also presented. A comparison of different performance metrics is then summarized. ADS operators have an obligation to report any incident (crash/disengagement) to safety regulating authorities. However, precrash events/states are not being reported. The need for the collection of the precrash scenario is described. A desirable modification to the data reporting/collecting is suggested as a framework. The framework describes the precrash sequences to be reported along with the possible ways of utilizing such a valuable dataset (by the safety regulating authorities) to comprehensively assess (and consequently improve) the safety of ADS. The framework proposes to collect and maintain a repository of precrash sequences. Such a repository can be used to 1) comprehensively learn and model the precrash scenarios, 2) learn the characteristics of precrash scenarios and eventually anticipate them, 3) assess the appropriateness of the different performance metrics in precrash scenarios, 4) synthesize a diverse dataset of precrash scenarios, 5) identify the ideal configuration of sensors and algorithms to enhance safety, and 6) monitor the performance of perception and motion planning modules.",

Hence, CAVs have to safely cooperate with the surrounding human drivers, in order to gain the benefits of autonomous driving technologies during such transition periods. In this paper, we present a Distributed Synchronous Intersection Protocol (DSIP) and a Cooperative Perception-based High-Definition Map (CP-HD Map) for mixed traffic environments, in which autonomous vehicles co-exist with human-driven vehicles. First, in DSIP, each CAV utilizes dynamic decision-making mechanisms to adaptively change the vehicle behaviors based on the surrounding environments by using vehicle states and vehicle mode. In addition, in CP-HD Map, each CAV uses Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications to share the information of detected objects to improve the road safety in the mixed traffic environments. Under these protocols, human-driven vehicles simply follow the traffic lights just like they do today. Finally, we show that DSIP and CP-HD Map increase the traffic throughput around the road intersections when we compared to existing signalized intersections and other V2V communications-based protocols.",

The interactive behavior considered in this research includes interactive events and trajectories that are modeled as spatial-temporal graphs using the GNN.

Secondly, a longitudinal game strategy for HVs is established with consideration of the driver's longitudinal handling characteristics and personalized aggressiveness, with which the driving behaviors of HVs can be accurately predicted. Thirdly, the longitudinal game strategies for AVs at different positions are designed, with consideration of the safety constraints of AVs and surrounding vehicles, as well as the objectives of comfort and traffic efficiency. Then, the interactive games of ego AV, HVs, and other AVs in different types of mixed-driving environments are solved based on the Stackelberg game and partial cooperative game methods. Finally, the optimal lane-changing (LC) gaps and longitudinal speed trajectories of AVs are obtained.

Most current autonomous driving algorithms make braking and stopping decisions in a traffic emergency. However, such decisions may not be optimal. In this paper, we study the optimal collision avoidance decision-making method for emergencies. To address this challenge, we propose a cooperative decision-making scheme for CAVs in an emergency. Unlike previous decision-making methods, our scheme enables vehicles to avoid collisions by indicating the optimal emergency destinations, which leads to a new task: the prediction of the optimal collision avoidance destination. In the proposed scheme, the potential collision avoidance destinations are evaluated based on a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, and we propose a safety evaluation map (SEM) to describe the evaluation results. The cooperative ability of CAVs is considered in the proposed scheme, and a well-designed reward function is applied to train the DRL model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately evaluate potential collision avoidance destinations and is effective in reducing traffic accident rates and accident damage in various traffic emergencies compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

Trajectory planning is a significant component of autonomous vehicle system, which directly influences the automated traffic safety.

We use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the probabilistic occupancy of the object and give a map from probability statistics to actual scenarios. The non-time-based reference trajectory can be obtained by using high-definition map and lane detection. Then model predictive control is utilized to optimize the reference trajectory according to the current state of autonomous vehicle. Different prediction horizons and coordinate transformation are adopted to optimize the planning. By doing so, the constraint conditions can be easily involved and the result is more intuitive. The probabilistic occupancy of other traffic participants are computed offline and then the obtained results are used in real-time application. Therefore, the real-time computational burden is reduced. The crash probability is put forward to verify the feasibility of real-time trajectory in safety assessment module.

        "abstract": "The article presents a review of recent literature on the performance metrics of Automated Driving Systems (ADS). More specifically, performance indicators of environment perception and motion planning modules are reviewed as they are the most complicated ADS modules. The need for the incorporation of the level of threat an obstacle poses in the performance metrics is described. A methodology to quantify the level of threat of an obstacle is presented in this regard. The approach involves simultaneously considering multiple stimulus parameters (that elicit responses from drivers), thereby not ignoring multivariate interactions. Human-likeness of ADS is a desirable characteristic as ADS share road infrastructure with humans. The described method can be used to develop human-like perception and motion planning modules of ADS. In this regard, performance metrics capable of quantifying human-likeness of ADS are also presented. A comparison of different performance metrics is then summarized. ADS operators have an obligation to report any incident (crash/disengagement) to safety regulating authorities. However, precrash events/states are not being reported. The need for the collection of the precrash scenario is described. A desirable modification to the data reporting/collecting is suggested as a framework. The framework describes the precrash sequences to be reported along with the possible ways of utilizing such a valuable dataset (by the safety regulating authorities) to comprehensively assess (and consequently improve) the safety of ADS. The framework proposes to collect and maintain a repository of precrash sequences. Such a repository can be used to 1) comprehensively learn and model the precrash scenarios, 2) learn the characteristics of precrash scenarios and eventually anticipate them, 3) assess the appropriateness of the different performance metrics in precrash scenarios, 4) synthesize a diverse dataset of precrash scenarios, 5) identify the ideal configuration of sensors and algorithms to enhance safety, and 6) monitor the performance of perception and motion planning modules.",

The interactive behavior considered in this research includes interactive events and trajectories that are modeled as spatial-temporal graphs using the GNN. Under the GNN-MTLF, the prediction process contains two main parts: recognition of interactive events and prediction of interactive trajectories.

Most current autonomous driving algorithms make braking and stopping decisions in a traffic emergency. However, such decisions may not be optimal. In this paper, we study the optimal collision avoidance decision-making method for emergencies. To address this challenge, we propose a cooperative decision-making scheme for CAVs in an emergency. Unlike previous decision-making methods, our scheme enables vehicles to avoid collisions by indicating the optimal emergency destinations, which leads to a new task: the prediction of the optimal collision avoidance destination. In the proposed scheme, the potential collision avoidance destinations are evaluated based on a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, and we propose a safety evaluation map (SEM) to describe the evaluation results. The cooperative ability of CAVs is considered in the proposed scheme, and a well-designed reward function is applied to train the DRL model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately evaluate potential collision avoidance destinations and is effective in reducing traffic accident rates and accident damage in various traffic emergencies compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

The non-time-based reference trajectory can be obtained by using high-definition map and lane detection. Then model predictive control is utilized to optimize the reference trajectory according to the current state of autonomous vehicle. Different prediction horizons and coordinate transformation are adopted to optimize the planning. By doing so, the constraint conditions can be easily involved and the result is more intuitive. The probabilistic occupancy of other traffic participants are computed offline and then the obtained results are used in real-time application.

        "abstract": "The article presents a review of recent literature on the performance metrics of Automated Driving Systems (ADS). More specifically, performance indicators of environment perception and motion planning modules are reviewed as they are the most complicated ADS modules. The need for the incorporation of the level of threat an obstacle poses in the performance metrics is described. A methodology to quantify the level of threat of an obstacle is presented in this regard. The approach involves simultaneously considering multiple stimulus parameters (that elicit responses from drivers), thereby not ignoring multivariate interactions. Human-likeness of ADS is a desirable characteristic as ADS share road infrastructure with humans. The described method can be used to develop human-like perception and motion planning modules of ADS. In this regard, performance metrics capable of quantifying human-likeness of ADS are also presented. A comparison of different performance metrics is then summarized. ADS operators have an obligation to report any incident (crash/disengagement) to safety regulating authorities. However, precrash events/states are not being reported. The need for the collection of the precrash scenario is described. A desirable modification to the data reporting/collecting is suggested as a framework. The framework describes the precrash sequences to be reported along with the possible ways of utilizing such a valuable dataset (by the safety regulating authorities) to comprehensively assess (and consequently improve) the safety of ADS. The framework proposes to collect and maintain a repository of precrash sequences. Such a repository can be used to 1) comprehensively learn and model the precrash scenarios, 2) learn the characteristics of precrash scenarios and eventually anticipate them, 3) assess the appropriateness of the different performance metrics in precrash scenarios, 4) synthesize a diverse dataset of precrash scenarios, 5) identify the ideal configuration of sensors and algorithms to enhance safety, and 6) monitor the performance of perception and motion planning modules.",

    "reviewContent": "## 1. 混合交通环境下的自动驾驶感知技术\n\n### 1.1 传感器融合与目标检测\n\n在混合交通环境下，自动驾驶系统需要准确感知周围环境并识别各类交通参与者。多传感器融合技术通过整合不同传感器的优势，显著提升了感知系统的鲁棒性和准确性。Wang等人[3]系统综述了基于LiDAR和摄像头的多传感器融合3D目标检测网络，指出根据融合位置的不同，可分为前期融合、中期融合和后期融合三种策略。前期融合直接在原始数据层面进行融合，能够保留最丰富的信息但计算复杂度较高；中期融合在特征层面进行融合，平衡了性能与效率；后期融合则在决策层面融合，实现简单但可能丢失重要信息。\n\nKocić等人[4]的研究进一步表明，相机、雷达和激光雷达的协同使用能够有效应对复杂交通场景。相机提供丰富的纹理和颜色信息，激光雷达提供精确的三维点云数据，而雷达则在恶劣天气条件下表现出色。通过深度融合这些异构传感器数据，自动驾驶系统能够实现全天候、全场景的可靠感知，这对于包含人工驾驶车辆和自动驾驶车辆的混合交通环境尤为重要。\n\n### 1.2 交通参与者行为预测\n\n准确预测交通参与者的行为是混合交通环境下自动驾驶系统安全高效运行的关键。Li等人[5]提出了一种基于图神经网络的多任务学习框架(GNN-MTLF)，将交互事件和轨迹建模为时空图，同时实现交互事件识别和轨迹预测。该框架利用车载传感器收集的数据，构建交通参与者间的交互关系图，通过图神经网络捕捉复杂的时空依赖关系，显著提升了预测精度。\n\n在混合交通中，人类驾驶员的行为具有高度的不确定性和个性化特征。Ma和Zhang[1]的研究发现，不同驾驶风格的驾驶员与自动驾驶车辆交互时的行为存在显著差异。攻击性驾驶员在与自动驾驶车辆交互时表现出更高的焦虑感、更低的不适感，并且更可能利用自动驾驶车辆的保守性进行超车等行为；而防御性驾驶员则不受交互车辆类型的显著影响。这一研究为建立考虑人类驾驶员个性化特征的预测模型提供了重要依据。\n\n### 1.3 环境感知不确定性处理\n\n混合交通环境的不确定性主要来源于传感器噪声、环境动态变化以及人类行为的不可预测性。Wang等人[8]提出了一种基于蒙特卡洛模拟的概率占据预测方法，通过模拟交通参与者的多种可能运动轨迹，生成概率占据图，为轨迹规划提供风险评估依据。该方法将概率统计映射到实际场景，能够离线计算其他交通参与者的概率占据，减轻实时计算负担。\n\nAoki和Rajkumar[2]开发的分布式同步交叉口协议(DSIP)利用协同感知技术，通过车辆间的信息共享减少局部感知的不确定性。在交叉口等复杂场景中，单一车辆的感知存在盲区，而通过车辆与基础设施、车辆与车辆间的协同感知，能够构建更完整的环境认知，提高混合交通流的安全性和效率。\n\n## 2. 混合车流中的决策与规划算法\n\n### 2.1 协同决策机制\n\n在混合交通环境中，自动驾驶车辆需要与人类驾驶车辆协同共存，这对决策系统提出了更高要求。Lv等人[7]针对紧急情况下的碰撞避免，提出了一种基于深度强化学习的协同决策方案。该方案通过构建安全评估图(SEM)评估潜在的避碰目的地，考虑网联自动驾驶车辆(CAVs)的协同能力，显著降低了交通事故率和事故损失。\n\nAoki和Rajkumar[2]的研究进一步表明，在交叉口管理等复杂场景中，集中式与分布式相结合的协同决策机制能够有效提升交通吞吐量和安全性。其提出的DSIP协议使得自动驾驶车辆能够与人类驾驶车辆安全协同，充分发挥自动驾驶技术优势，同时适应过渡期内混合交通的特点。\n\n### 2.2 轨迹规划与安全性评估\n\n轨迹规划是自动驾驶系统的核心组成部分，直接影响交通安全。Wang等人[8]将运动预测与模型预测控制相结合，提出了一种考虑其他交通参与者概率占据的轨迹规划方法。该方法使用非时间参考轨迹，结合高清地图和车道检测信息，通过不同预测时域和坐标变换优化规划结果，并在安全评估模块中引入碰撞概率验证实时轨迹的可行性。\n\nYan等人[6]构建了一个多车辆博弈论框架，综合考虑安全性、舒适性和交通效率目标。该框架包含自动驾驶车辆与人类驾驶车辆间的非合作博弈，以及自我自动驾驶车辆与其他自动驾驶车辆间的部分合作博弈。通过建立考虑驾驶员纵向操纵特性和个性化攻击性的人类驾驶车辆纵向博弈策略，准确预测人类驾驶车辆行为，最终获得最优换道间隙和纵向速度轨迹。\n\n### 2.3 人机交互与博弈策略\n\n混合交通本质上是自动驾驶系统与人类驾驶员的共融系统，理解并建模人机交互至关重要。Ma和Zhang[1]的研究量化了驾驶风格和交互类型对驾驶员主观感受和决策的影响，揭示了人类驾驶员如何感知和与自动驾驶车辆交互，以及如何利用自动驾驶车辆的行为特点。这些发现为设计符合人类期望的自动驾驶交互策略提供了实证基础。\n\nYan等人[6]的博弈论轨迹规划框架考虑了人类驾驶员的个性化攻击性和响应延迟，通过Stackelberg博弈和部分合作博弈方法，解决了自我自动驾驶车辆、人类驾驶车辆和其他自动驾驶车辆在不同类型混合驾驶环境中的交互博弈。人机在环实验结果表明，该框架能够有效处理包含不同攻击性和响应延迟人类驾驶车辆的换道场景。\n\n## 3. 自动驾驶系统集成与验证\n\n### 3.1 仿真测试平台构建\n\n仿真测试是验证自动驾驶系统性能的重要手段，特别是在混合交通这种复杂且安全性要求高的场景中。Wang等人[9]开发的ADEPT测试平台基于CARLA模拟器，提供了场景构建、自动驾驶系统导入、测试执行和记录等测试设施。该平台的特色在于两种测试场景生成策略：一是利用真实事故报告，通过自然语言处理技术构建丰富的驾驶场景；二是通过考虑自动驾驶系统的反馈合成物理鲁棒的对抗攻击，生成闭环测试场景。\n\nADEPT平台能够模拟混合交通环境中人类驾驶员与自动驾驶车辆的交互，包括不同驾驶风格的人类驾驶员行为[1]，为测试自动驾驶系统在真实世界中的表现提供了高度逼真的仿真环境。\n\n### 3.2 实车道路测试方法\n\n实车道路测试是验证自动驾驶系统性能的最终环节，但在混合交通环境中进行测试存在安全性和复杂性挑战。Sharath和Mehran[10]指出，当前自动驾驶系统运营商有义务向安全监管机构报告任何事故(碰撞/脱离)，但事故前状态未被报告。他们建议收集事故前场景数据，建立事故前序列库，用于全面评估和提高自动驾驶系统的安全性。\n\n在实车测试中，需要考虑混合交通的特殊性，包括人类驾驶员对自动驾驶车辆的不同反应[1]，以及自动驾驶车辆与人类驾驶车辆的安全协同[2]。测试方案应涵盖典型的混合交通场景，如交叉口通行、车道变更、紧急避让等，全面评估自动驾驶系统的性能。\n\n### 3.3 性能评估指标体系\n\n建立全面的性能评估指标体系对于衡量混合交通环境下自动驾驶系统的表现至关重要。Sharath和Mehran[10]综述了自动驾驶系统的性能指标，特别关注环境感知和运动规划这两个最复杂的模块。他们提出需要考虑障碍物构成的威胁级别，并同时考虑多个刺激参数(引发驾驶员反应的参数)，从而不忽略多变量相互作用。\n\n评估指标应涵盖安全性、效率、舒适性等多个维度。在安全性方面，除了传统的碰撞率、脱离接触率等指标外，还应考虑在接近事故场景中的表现[10]。在效率方面，评估指标应包括交通吞吐量、行程时间等。舒适性则可通过加速度、加加速度等指标衡量。此外，由于自动驾驶系统与人类共享道路基础设施，评估指标还应能够量化自动驾驶系统的人类相似度[10]，这对于提高混合交通环境中人类驾驶员的接受度和安全感尤为重要[1]。",
