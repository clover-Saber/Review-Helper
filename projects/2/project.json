In this work, we look into the other domains and technologies required to build an autonomous vehicle and conduct a relevant literature analysis. In this work, we look into the current state of research and development in environment detection, pedestrian detection, path planning, motion control, and vehicle cybersecurity for autonomous vehicles. We aim to study the different proposed technologies and compare their approaches. For a car to become fully autonomous, these technologies need to be accurate enough to gain public trust and show immense accuracy in their approach to solving these problems. Public trust and perception of auto vehicles are also explored in this paper. By discussing the opportunities as well as the obstacles of autonomous driving technology, we aim to shed light on future possibilities.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a stochastic model for mixed traffic flow with human-driven vehicles (HVs) and automated vehicles (AVs). The model is formulated in Lagrangian coordinates considering the heterogeneous behavior of human drivers. We further derive a first and second order approximation of the stochastic model describing the mean and the covariance dynamics, respectively, under different combinations of HVs and AVs in the traffic stream (e.g., randomly distributed in the stream, at the front of the stream, in the middle of the stream and in the rear of the stream). The proposed model allows us to explicitly investigate the interaction between AVs and HVs considering the uncertainty of human driving behavior. Six performance metrics are proposed to measure the impact of AVs on the uncertainty of HVs’ behavior, as well as on the stability of the system. The numerical experiment results show that AVs have significant impact on the uncertainty and stability of the mixed traffic flow system. Larger AV penetration rates can reduce the uncertainty inherent in HV behavior and improve the stability of the mixed flow substantially. Whereas AVs’ reaction time only has subtle impact on the uncertainty of the mixed stream; as well as the position of AVs in the traffic stream has marginal influence in terms of reducing uncertainty and improving stability.",

        "abstract": "Vehicle automation and communication technologies are considered promising approaches to improve operational driving behavior. The expected gradual implementation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) shortly will cause unique impacts on the traffic flow characteristics. This paper focuses on reviewing the expected impacts under a mixed traffic environment of AVs and regular vehicles (RVs) considering different AV characteristics. The paper includes a policy implication discussion for possible actual future practice and research interests. The AV implementation has positive impacts on the traffic flow, such as improved traffic capacity and stability. However, the impact depends on the factors including penetration rate of the AVs, characteristics, and operational settings of the AVs, traffic volume level, and human driving behavior. The critical penetration rate, which has a high potential to improve traffic characteristics, was higher than 40%. AV’s intelligent control of operational driving is a function of its operational settings, mainly car-following modeling. Different adjustments of these settings may improve some traffic flow parameters and may deteriorate others. The position and distribution of AVs and the type of their leading or following vehicles may play a role in maximizing their impacts.",

        "abstract": "The rapid improvements in communication and self-driving technology in recent years have made connected autonomous cars an essential component of urban road transit. Connected autonomous vehicles excel in eliminating uncertainties arising from human driving behaviors. Consequently, they alleviate the issue of 'phantom congestion', a phenomenon that significantly impacts traffic efficiency, safety and sustainability while simultaneously enhancing overall traffic flow stability and safety. Moreover, the increasing adoption of connected autonomous vehicles has led to improved driving efficiency, resulting in reduced energy emissions and decreased environmental pollution. This paper endeavors to conduct an extensive review concerning the effects of CAVs on mixed traffic flows, with a primary emphasis on their impact on traffic efficiency and congestion. Additionally, secondary aspects such as stability, safety, and environmental repercussions will be addressed. The article begins with a concise historical account of connected autonomous vehicles and their related technologies. Subsequently, an investigation was conducted into their impact on the mixed traffic environment, along with corresponding policy recommendations. Finally, potential avenues for future research were identified.",

Understanding the effects of Connected Vehicles (CVs) and Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), as one of the vehicle components of mixed traffic flows, will make it easier to avoid traffic congestion and contribute to the creation of innovative applications and solutions. It is notable that the literature related to the analysis of the impact of mixed traffic flows on traffic signal control in urban areas rarely considers mixed traffic flow containing CVs, CAVs, and Human Driven Vehicles (HDVs). Therefore, this paper provides an overview of the relevant research papers covering the topic of urban Traffic Signal Control (TSC) and mixed traffic flows. Best practices for intersection state estimation and TSC in the case of mixed traffic flows in an urban environment are summarized and possible approaches for utilizing CVs and CAVs as mobile sensors and actuators are discussed.",

        "abstract": "This paper analyzes the characteristics of mixed traffic flow with maximum platoon size of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) based on analytical and simulation methods. First, we discuss the car-following and headway types of mixed traffic flows with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs), automated vehicles (AVs), and CAVs. Second, the probability distribution of the CAVs platoon size is derived based on the Markov chain model. Subsequently, the capacity model and stability condition of mixed traffic flow are proposed based on the probability distribution of the CAVs platoon size, and some characteristics of the influence of the maximum platoon size on traffic capacity and stability are analyzed. A numerical experiment based on car-following models was conducted to investigate the effect of the maximum platoon size on capacity, stability, safety, fuel consumption, and emission of mixed traffic flow. The results show that (1) the capacity of mixed traffic flow increases with the maximum platoon size of CAVs; (2) the stability of mixed traffic flow deteriorates with the increase in the maximum platoon size of CAVs; (3) the safety risk of vehicles in mixed traffic flow increases with the maximum platoon size of CAVs; (4) the fuel consumption and emissions (e.g., CO, HC, and NOx) increase with the maximum platoon size of CAVs. This indicates that the larger maximum platoon size can only improve traffic capacity, which is not conducive to the stability, safety, fuel consumption, and emissions of mixed traffic flow.",

        "abstract": "Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) can potentially improve the performance of the transportation system by reducing human errors. This paper investigates the safety impact of CAVs in a mixed traffic with conventional vehicles at intersections. Analyzing real-world AV crashes in California revealed that rear-end crashes at intersections are the dominant crash type. Therefore, to enhance our understanding of the future interactions between human-driven vehicles with CAVs at intersections, a simulation framework was developed to model the mixed traffic environment of Automated Vehicles (AV), cooperative AVs, and conventional human-driven vehicles. In order to model AVs driving behavior, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and cooperative ACC (CACC) models are utilized. Particularly, this study explores system improvements due to automation and connectivity across varying CAV market penetration scenarios. ACC and CACC car following models are used to mimic the behavior of AVs and cooperative AVs. Real-world connected vehicle data are utilized to modify and tune the acceleration/deceleration regimes of the Wiedemann model. Next, the driving volatility concept capturing variability in vehicle speeds was utilized to calibrate the simulation to represent the safety performance of a real-world environment. Two surrogate safety measures are used to evaluate the safety performance of a representative intersection under different market penetration rate of CAVs: the number of longitudinal conflicts and driving volatility. At low levels of ACC market penetration, the safety improvements were found to be marginal, but safety improved substantially with more than 40% ACC penetration. Additional safety improvements can be achieved more quickly through the addition of cooperation and connectivity through CACC. Furthermore, ACC/CACC vehicles were found to improve mobility performance in terms of average speed and travel time at intersections.",
